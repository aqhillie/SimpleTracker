# SimpleTracker

Simple Tracker is a simple item tracker for Super Metroid Map Rando.

It is based on an unknown pack for EmoTracker that a lot of SM speed runners and rando players use.

I couldn't find it anywhere so I pieced it together from screenshots and other random trackers I found in various places.

## Features

Currently you can cycle through Objectives, Difficulty, Item Progression, Quality of Life and Map Layout seed options to match the current seed you're playing.

Press Command-R to reset the tracker (reset all bosses to alive - all items to not found/0)

You can enable collectible wall jump via the settings menu, and soon will be able to enable showing of the planet "wake" status (eye ball / spy camera) in the item tracker.

Recently added is an optional seed name at the top where you can type in the current seed name, which is not a Map Rando option but I have named my seeds since the very beginning because the hash is not the best way to identify them :P

Name can be hidden and shown from the settings menu.

If you want to help with this project and are familiar with EmoTracker or can send me this EmoTracker pack pls email to alex@warpixel.dev

Eventually I would like to learn the features of Emo Tracker and possibly implement them, not necessarily in this project but in a future project.

I think it's best this tracker remain simple, thus the name SimpleTracker :)
