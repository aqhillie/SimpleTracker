# SimpleTracker

Simple Tracker is a simple item tracker for Super Metroid Map Rando.

It is based on an unknown pack for EmoTracker that a lot of SM speed runners and rando players use.

I couldn't find it anywhere so I pieced it together from screenshots and other random trackers I found in various places.

Update: I was finally able to find the pack. It was written by chicdead26 and I have since implemented all the features (I believe) of the pack.

## Features

Currently you can cycle through Objectives, Difficulty, Item Progression, Quality of Life and Map Layout seed options to match the current seed you're playing.

Press Command-R to reset the tracker (reset all bosses to alive - all items to not found/0)

You can enable collectible wall jump via the settings menu, and soon will be able to enable showing of the planet "wake" status (eye ball / spy camera) in the item tracker.

I also have added an optional timer so that if anyone can have a timer ready to go baked into the tracker, in case they don't have a normal timer or don't want to set one up in OBS.

Eventually I would like to learn the features of Emo Tracker and possibly implement them, not necessarily in this project but in a future project.

I think it's best this tracker remain simple, thus the name SimpleTracker :)
